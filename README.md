Rosalind Project - AWK
======================

Solving the Project Rosalind problems using `awk`, with the goal of learning it
in depth and pushing it to the limit. I'm not yet sure where it will break.

Each problem is solved with an `awk` script, typically called `solution.awk`.
The script is tested with a simple `bash` script called `test` and there is a
master `test_all` script that should run all tests.
