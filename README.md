Rosalind Project - AWK
======================

Solving the [Rosalind Project](http://rosalind.info) problems with `awk`, the
goal is to learn it in depth and push it to the limit. I'm not yet sure where
it will break.

Each problem is solved with an `awk` script, typically called `solution`.  The
script is tested with a simple `bash` script called `test` and there is a master
`test_all` script that should run all tests.
