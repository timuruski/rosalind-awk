Rosalind Project - AWK
======================

Solving the [Rosalind Project](http://rosalind.info) problems with `awk`, the
goal is to learn it in depth and push it to the limit. I'm not yet sure where
it will break.

*IMPORTANT* If you are solving the problems yourself or have any desire to, 
please do not look at this project, as it contains spoilers. Posting solutions
is [discouraged](http://rosalind.info/faq/#can-i-post-my-solutions-somewhere),
but I have decided to keep these visible for the time being.

Each problem is solved with an `awk` script, typically called `solution`.  The
script is tested with a simple `bash` script called `test` and there is a master
`test_all` script that should run all tests.
